# 🌍 Roblox Global Strategy: Project "Tier 1 Hunter"

## 1. Goal & Philosophy
*   **Target**: Tier 1 Markets (US, EU, UK, Canada). Avoid Tier 3 (India, SE Asia).
*   **Method**: 100% Non-verbal, Original Character, Manual Sound Design.
*   **Philosophy**: "Visual Quality over Quantity". Each video is an Indie Short Film, not a SpamClip.

### 1.1 Financial Potential (Why Go Global?)
*   **Scale**: Achieving 10M-50M views is *common* for global hits, whereas in Japan it's a once-in-a-lifetime unirevent. The ceiling is 100x higher.
*   **RPM (Revenue Per 1,000 Views)**:
    *   **Japan Shorts**: ~0.01 - 0.03 USD (1-5 JPY).
    *   **US/Tier 1 Shorts**: ~0.06 - 0.12 USD (10-20 JPY). **3x-5x higher**.
    *   *Example*: 10M views in Japan = 300,000 JPY. 10M views in US = 1,500,000 JPY.


## 2. Character Design (The "Indie" Anchor)
Avoid "Human" or "Generic Roblox". Aim for **"Toy/Mascot Horror"** vibes.
*   **Head**: Object Head (TV, Pumpkin, Camera, etc.) or Non-Human Mask.
*   **Texture**: "Glossy Plastic", "Vinyl Toy", "Cinematic Lighting" (Veo 3 Prompt).
*   **Style**: Lego Movie Quality. Blocky shape but Premium Material.

### 2.1 Why this Design? (Rationale)
1.  **Cultural Neutrality (The Object Head)**:
    *   Human faces carry racial/national traits. A "TV Head" or "Pumpkin" is universal.
    *   It bypasses bias and allows viewers from US/EU to project themselves onto the character.
2.  **Meme Potential (The Skibidi Effect)**:
    *   Weird/Surreal characters are more sharable. "Standard Humans" are boring.
    *   Tier 1 audiences love "Cursed/Blursed" imagery (Uncanny but cute).
3.  **Uncanny Valley Avoidance**:
    *   AI-generated humans look creepy in a bad way (melting faces).
    *   AI-generated *Toys* look styled and intentional. It turns a bug into a feature.
4.  **Market Fit (Mascot Horror)**:
    *   Aligns with the biggest trend in Western Indie Animation (Poppy Playtime, Digital Circus).
    *   High-gloss visuals signal "High Budget" to adult viewers.

### 2.2 Success Evidence (Why Object Heads Win)
The "Object Head" (TV, Camera, Monitor) is a **Proven Viral Trope** in internet culture, not a random guess.
1.  **Skibidi Toilet (2023-2024)**: The "Cameramen", "Speakermen", and "TV Men" (Alliance) are all Object Heads. They are the heroes of the most viral series of the decade (65B+ views).
2.  **Hazbin Hotel (2024)**: "Vox" (The TV Demon) is one of the most popular characters in this global hit show.
3.  **Daft Punk (Music)**: The original "Robot Head" icons.
4.  **Roblox Trend (Weirdcore/Dreamcore)**:
    *   Gen Z/Alpha loves "Liminal Spaces" and "Surreal avatars".
    *   Object heads fit the "Weirdcore" aesthetic perfectly.
    *   They are "Cool" and "Edgy", not "Cute" (which is for babies).



## 3. Production Methodology (Hybrid)
*   **Visuals (AI)**: Google Veo 3.
    *   *Input*: Roblox Screenshots (Blocky Base).
    *   *Prompt Key*: `Cinematic Lighting`, `Toy Texture`, `Subsurface Scattering`.
    *   *Technique*: Scene-by-scene generation. No long continuous shots (to prevent melting).
*   **Audio (Human - CRITICAL)**:
    *   *No AI Voices/Music*.
    *   *Foley*: `Boing`, `Bonk`, `Slide Whistle`, `Whoosh`, `Punchy Kick`.
    *   *Timing*: Sync sound to action perfectly (Mickey Mousing).
    *   **Character Voice (The "Simlish" Strategy)**:
        *   Do NOT use standard AI voices.
        *   **Record Yourself (Gibberish)**: Grunts, Screams, "Hey!", "Huh?".
        *   **Process**: Pitch Shift (+30% for 'Generic Cute', -20% for 'Villain').
        *   *Reference*: Minions, The Sims, Pingu, Animal Crossing.
        *   *Advantage*: Unique IP, No Language Barrier, 100% Owned.

## 4. Platform Strategy (The "Escape Velocity")
*   **Metadata**: English ONLY. No Japanese characters.
*   **Topics**: Piggyback on Global Keywords (`Skibidi`, `Minecraft`, `Amazing Digital Circus`, `ASMR`, `Satisfying`).
*   **Engagement**: Reply to comments in English. Hide Japanese comments if necessary initially.

### 4.1 Account Structure (The "Clean Slate" Protocol)
*   **New vs Old**: Must create a **Brand New Google Account**.
    *   *Reason*: Old accounts have "Japanese Watch History" attached to them. The algorithm uses this history to "find similar users" (i.e., other Japanese people). You must kill this signal.
*   **Settings for New Account**:
    1.  **Google Account Language**: English (US).
    2.  **YouTube Location**: United States (Signal).
    3.  **Phone Verification**: Japanese Number (Safe/Okay).
    4.  **AdSense (Future)**: Japan (Must match your tax residency/bank).
*   **Behavior**: Do NOT watch Japanese YouTube videos on this account. Only watch US trends to "train" the algorithm's recommendations for you.

### 4.2 Isolation Protocol (Browser Separation)
To prevent accidental "Japanese Searches" or cookie pollution:
1.  **Strict Browser Separation**:
    *   **Chrome**: For your Personal/Japan daily life.
    *   **Firefox / Edge / Brave**: **EXCLUSIVE for the Global Brand Account.**
    *   *Why?*: Google tracks across tabs. Using a separate browser physically walls off your data.
2.  **Search Hygiene**:
    *   **Do**: Search for `Roblox`, `Minecraft`, `Skibidi` in English on the Global Browser to "train" the algorithm that you are an English speaker.
    *   **Don't**: Search for `天気 (Weather)` or `ニュース (News)` in Japanese. One slip can pollute the recommended feed.
    *   **The "Zero-Touch" Myth**: Don't just leave it empty. An empty account defaults to IP location (Japan). You MUST seed it with English watch history.

## 5. Monetization Defense (The 8:2 Logic)
*   **Originality**: Owned Character IP.
*   **Human Effort**: Manual Sound Design & Story Structure are the "Editorial Proof".
*   **Human Effort**: Manual Sound Design & Story Structure are the "Editorial Proof".
*   **Risk**: Low as long as quality is high. Avoid mass production/spam.

### 5.1 Content Maturity (Adult Themes)
*   **Concept**: Yes, "Roblox Drama" (Cheating, Breakups, Exposing) is a massive Tier 1 niche (Storytime Animation).
*   **Target**: Teens & Young Adults (13-24). Not "Kids".
*   **Execution**: Do NOT show explicit scenes. Implied drama (text messages, crying, slamming doors) is safer and more viral.
*   **Keyword**: `Roblox Storytime` `Sad Story` `Cheating Prank`.

### 5.2 Posting Schedule (Quality First)
*   **Frequency**: 2-3 High-Quality Shorts per week.
*   **Why?**:
    *   Daily posting lowers quality -> Spam detection risk increases.
    *   YouTube needs time (24-48h) to test global audiences. Over-posting confuses the algorithm.
*   **Goal**: Each video should aim for 1M+ views over time (Evergreen), not quick hits.

## 6. Project Structure
`Antigravity/ロブロックス海外/`
*   `Scripts/`: Non-verbal storyboards.
*   `Assets/`: Character reference sheets (Screenshots).
*   `Audio/`: SFX libraries (Splice/Epidemic).

## 7. Creative Library (IP Concepts)

### 7.1 Character Archetypes (Object Heads)
1.  **TV-Head (The Glitch)**:
    *   **Head**: Old CRT Monitor. Screen displays static or emoji eyes ( >_< ).
    *   **Body**: Sharp Business Suit (Matrix vibe).
    *   **Personality**: Always glitches through walls. Cool but clumsy.
    *   **Texture**: Scratched plastic screen, fabric suit.
2.  **Cone-Head (The Victim)**:
    *   **Head**: Orange Traffic Cone.
    *   **Body**: Yellow Construction Vest.
    *   **Personality**: The "Unlucky Guy". Always gets crushed by anvils or falls off maps.
    *   **Texture**: High-gloss orange plastic (wet look).
3.  **CCTV-Head (The Watcher)**:
    *   **Head**: Security Camera with a glowing red lens.
    *   **Body**: Black Tactical Gear.
    *   **Personality**: Serious but gets pranked by everyone. Lens zooms in/out for comedic effect.
    *   **Texture**: Matte black metal + Glass lens.

### 7.2 Story Archetypes (15s Loops)
*   **Target**: "Oddly Satisfying" or "Surreal Humor".
1.  **The Physics Fail (Slapstick)**:
    *   *0-5s*: Character walks confidently towards a chair.
    *   *5-10s*: Sits down -> Chair instantly explodes into 1000 tiny blocks (physics glitch).
    *   *10-15s*: Character looks at camera (Zoom in). *Sound: Vine Boom*.
2.  **The Infinite Portal (Loop)**:
    *   *0-5s*: Character falls into a hole in the floor.
    *   *5-10s*: Falls past weird objects (ducks, pianos).
    *   *10-15s*: Lands... back at the start point. Seamless loop.
3.  **The Texture Glitch (ASMR)**:
    *   *0-5s*: Character touches a wall.
    *   *5-10s*: The wall turns into liquid/slime and splashes.
    *   *10-15s*: Character panics and turns into water too. *Sound: Splash*.

## 8. Recommended Themes (Viral Niches)

### 8.1 The "Justice" Theme (High Retention)
*   **Concept**: *Bullied Noob vs Arrogant Rich Guy*.
*   **Plot**: Rich guy kicks Noob. Noob finds a secret item. Noob destroys Rich Guy's house.
*   **Why**: Universal emotion (Schadenfreude/Justice). Everyone loves seeing a bully lose.
*   **Visuals**: Dirt House vs Golden Mansion.

### 8.2 The "Evolution" Theme (Satisfying)
*   **Concept**: *Lv.1 Crook -> Lv.50 Boss -> Lv.100 God*.
*   **Plot**: Character eats items and grows bigger/shiny.
*   **Why**: Visual progression keeps viewers watching until the end (to see the final form).

### 8.3 The "Liminal Horror" Theme (Mystery)
*   **Concept**: *The Backrooms / Poolrooms*.
*   **Plot**: Character is walking in an endless yellow room. Hears a noise. Runs. Something chases him (but we don't see it clearly).
*   **Why**: Fits "Object Head" aesthetic perfectly. High comment engagement ("What was that??").

### 8.4 The "Tycoon Construction" Theme (ASMR)
*   **Concept**: *Speed Build*.
*   **Plot**: Character steps on a button. A house builds itself piece by piece (ASMR sounds required: Click, Clack, Pop).
*   **Why**: Extremely satisfying to watch. No story needed, just visual pleasure.

## 9. Automated Script Pipeline (Claude Code Strategy)
*   **Concept**: Use "Agent Teams" to autonomous script generation.
*   **Roles**:
    1.  **The Director (Architect)**: Generates the Plot/Twist.
    2.  **The Screenwriter (Writer)**: Converts Plot to Shot List (Camera Angles, Action).
    3.  **The Critic (Auditor)**: Checks for Logic Gaps and Engagement Killers.
*   **Command**: `claude production --plot "Rich vs Poor" --style "Slapstick"`
*   **Goal**: Zero-touch script generation. You only review the final output.

### 9.1 Technical Stack (The "Antigravity" Replica)
*   **Brain (Memory)**: Local Markdown Files (`Strategy_Master.md`, `Scripts/*.md`).
    *   *Note*: Claude Code reads these files to understand "Context" and "Rules", just like Antigravity.
*   **Sync (Cloud)**: **GitHub**.
    *   *Method*: Use `universal_sync.sh` to push changes from PC A -> Pull on PC B.
    *   *Result*: Your "AI Employee" has the same memory on every device.
*   **Interface**: Terminal / VS Code.
    *   *Method*: Use `universal_sync.sh` to push changes from PC A -> Pull on PC B.
    *   *Result*: Your "AI Employee" has the same memory on every device.
*   **Interface**: Terminal / VS Code.
    *   *Agent*: Claude Code (CLI) operates directly on your local files.

### 9.2 Mobile Workflow (Smartphone Access)
*   **Direct Access**: No, Claude Code is a PC Terminal tool.
*   **Review Mode (GitHub Mobile App)**:
    *   *Action*: Review scripts generated by PC/Claude. Add comments.
    *   *Benefit*: Perfect for "Director Mode" (Checking plotting on the train).
*   **Generation Mode (Web Interface)**:
    *   *Action*: Copy prompt from Notes -> Paste into Claude.ai (Web).
*   **Review Mode (GitHub Mobile App)**:
    *   *Action*: Review scripts generated by PC/Claude. Add comments.
    *   *Benefit*: Perfect for "Director Mode" (Checking plotting on the train).
*   **Generation Mode (Web Interface)**:
    *   *Action*: Copy prompt from Notes -> Paste into Claude.ai (Web).
    *   *Limitation*: Cannot directly edit local files. Must copy/paste back later.

### 9.3 The "Night Shift" Protocol (Zero-Touch)
*   **Concept**: AI works while you sleep.
*   **Method**: Run a loop command before bed.
    *   `for i in {1..3}; do claude production --random-topic; done`
*   **Morning Routine**:
    1.  Wake up.
    2.  Open `Scripts/Drafts/`.
    3.  See 3 new scripts (e.g., "The Flying Pig", "Glitch House", "Speed Run").
    4.  **Approve/Reject**: You become the "Executive Producer", not the writer.
    3.  See 3 new scripts (e.g., "The Flying Pig", "Glitch House", "Speed Run").
    4.  **Approve/Reject**: You become the "Executive Producer", not the writer.
    *   *Status*: **Fully Achievable with Claude Code + Antigravity.**

### 9.4 Folder Compatibility (Plug & Play)
*   **Question**: Can I use the `Antigravity` folder structure with Claude Code?
*   **Answer**: **YES. It is designed for it.**
    *   *How*: Open Terminal -> `cd ~/Desktop/Antigravity/ロブロックス海外` -> `claude` (or whatever the command is).
    *   *Context*: Claude will read `Strategy_Master.md` automatically if you tell it to (or if it scans the dir).
    *   *No Migration Needed*: The files I created (`.md`, `.tsv`, `.py`) are universal text files. They work with ANY AI (Claude, GPT, Gemini).
